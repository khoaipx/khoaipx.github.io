Welcome ðŸ‘‹,

I am a data scientist with over 8 years of experience, including more than 3 years of managing a high-performing team. I successfully built a data science team from the ground up, which currently has 12 members and peaked at 18 members.

I have leveraged AI and data analysis to enhance production and streamline workflows, driving the company towards data-driven decision-making.
